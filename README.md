## Xamarin Application Example with .NET Core 2, ASP.NET Core MVC Web App, and Azure Databases (with Email Notification)

### Description:
This repository contains a comprehensive example of an application that combines a Xamarin mobile app with an ASP.NET Core MVC web app. Both applications are designed to interact with databases hosted on Microsoft Azure and include the functionality to send email notifications.

### Key Features:
- Xamarin Application: The mobile app is developed using Xamarin, enabling the creation of native Android and iOS apps from a single codebase. The app features an intuitive interface and allows users to perform specific actions related to data stored in the cloud database. Additionally, the app can send email notifications to users to keep them informed about important events or updates.

- ASP.NET Core MVC Web App: The web app is built on ASP.NET Core 2 and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. This app allows users to access the same data as the Xamarin app but from any device with internet access. The web UI is user-friendly and supports easy navigation. The web app also includes the ability to send email notifications to users.

- Integration with Azure Databases: Both applications are connected to databases hosted on Microsoft Azure. Azure SQL Database is used to store and manage application data. The Azure integration provides reliable scalability and efficient data management.

- Email Notification: The application includes functionality to send email notifications to users based on specific triggers or events. Whether it's notifying users of new updates, important alerts, or personalized messages, the email notification feature enhances user engagement and communication.

### Repository Contents:
- Source Code: The repository contains the complete source code of the Xamarin and ASP.NET Core MVC applications, including all necessary files and dependencies to run and build the app.

- Documentation: Detailed guides and documentation are provided to set up the development environment, connect the applications to Azure databases, and implement the email notification feature.

- Sample Data: Sample data is included to test the applications. This sample data allows users to interact with the app without the need to enter data from scratch.
